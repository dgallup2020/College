Files

Files are the most common form of a stream. 
The first thing we must do is open a file. The function fopen() does 
this: 
   FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode) 
   fopen returns a pointer to a FILE. The name string is the name of 
   the file on disc that we wish to access. The mode string controls 
   our type of access. If a file cannot be accessed for any reason a 
   NULL pointer is returned. 
   
   Modes include: "r" -- read,
       "w" -- write and
           "a" -- append.
           To open a file we must have a stream (file pointer) that 
           points to a FILE structure. 
           So to open a file, called myfile.dat for reading we would 
           do: 
           
           
             FILE *stream, *fopen();
                 /* declare a stream and prototype fopen */ 
                  
                       stream = fopen("myfile.dat","r");
                        
                        
                        it is good practice to to check file is 
                        opened 
                        correctly:
                         
                             if ( (stream = fopen( "myfile.dat",
                                        "r")) == NULL)
                                                 {  printf("Can't 
                                                 open %s\n"",
                                                             "myfile.dat");
                                                                      exit(1);
                                                                               }
                                                                                   ......
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
                                                                                   Reading and writing files
                                                                                   
                                                                                   The functions fprintf and fscanf a commonly used to access files. 
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
                                                                                   int fprintf(FILE *stream, char *format, args..)
                                                                                       int fscanf(FILE *stream, char *format, args..)
                                                                                       
                                                                                       These are similar to printf and scanf except that data is read from the stream that must have been opened with fopen(). 
                                                                                       
                                                                                       The stream pointer is automatically incremented with ALL file read/write functions. We do not have to worry about doing this.

Both achieve the same result!!
