Due: Wednesday or Thursday

See the files in HW/lab13/

You should run each one to see how it works.  Each prints out which
file from class you should use as a starting point.  As always,
create a ~/HW/lab13/ directory, and name your .cpp files the same
as the programs in HW/lab13/

More details and hints may be posted sometime.

lab13_io
  * for reading one line at a time, use getline (the C++ version)
  * use string find function to look for bad and well in first response,
    and look for Harry Potter, Hitchhiker's Guide, Lord of the Rings in second respons

lab13_files
  * either read one line at a time (and write it out to f_out), or read
    one character at a time (and write it out to f_out) using get

lab13_overloading
  * add operators to rational class for - / *
  * read in q1.top, q1.bottom, q2.top, q2.bottom with cin
  * compute each of the operations and print them
  * note - you do need to use the file as it was.

lab13_stack
  * just adding cout statements for push/pop, and doing an operation

lab13_vector
  * vector should be of double
  * loop should read double
  * after cin while loop, have a for loop to compute total
  * after total is calculated, loop through the numbers and print percentages
