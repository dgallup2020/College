Note: if no grade given for problem, then 0 credit.  Each problem
given 1, 2/3, 1/3, or 0.  If a program does not compile it is
worth 0 credit.

1) 1/2 - need { } to have outermost for loop do for and printf
2) 2/3 - you flipped role of . and !
3) 1
4) 0
5) 1

Grading is: best program worth 12, next best worth 6, then 6, 3, and 3.

total (out of 30): 12 + 6 + 4 + 1.5 = 23.5
