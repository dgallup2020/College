hw2 proposal with xv6 utility

-Making a stack calculator (RPN Calculator)
./rpmcalc 5 6 7 + - 4 * ......... (max size is 100 arguments)

answer return should be 32;
since we did 7+6 = 13
13 - 5 = 8
8 * 4 = 32

the calculator has two stacks: a numeration stack and a operation stack
the numeration stack is added to until we have a new operation to come. then
if we did we take the top two number off of the numeration stack. this repeats
until we either only have one number left on the stack or we ran out of
operations;
