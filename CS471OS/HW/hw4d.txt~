OSTEP CHAPTER REVIEW: Dylan Gallup

Chapter 16: Segmentation
The Big Issue:
How to support a large address space with a lot of free space between
the stack and heap.

- Segmentation Generalized: Bases and Bounds

Segment: A contiguous portion of the address space of a particular length.
in this case we have the stack, heap, and the code.

Segmentation: Implementing a base and bounds pair per logical segment of the
address space. Segmentation allows the OS to put each of the different
segments to different parts of physical memory. 

Sparse Address Spaces: Large address spaces with large amounts of unused
address space. 

Segmentation Fault: Happens when memory accesss on a segmented machine is to
an illegal address. Specifically - the hardware traps into the OS and ending
that process. 

- Knowing Which Segment We Are Refering To?

The Explicit Approach: to chop up the address space into segements based on
the top few bits of the Virtual Address.

The Implicit Approach: the hardware deteremines the segment by noticing how
the address was formed. Relating where the address was generated to where it
should be segmented. stuff from the stack must be in the stack segment.

- What About The Stack?

The Stack is different because it grows larger backwards compared to the code
and the heap segment. Stack has to be translated differently because of this.
