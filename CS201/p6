1.  Write a program that reads character input until EOF. It keeps track of
    26 frequencies: A's (upper and lower case combined in one frequency), 
    B's (upper and lower case combined in one frequency), and so on through
    Z's. The final results should be printed out. ex6.1.c

2.  Write a program that reads character input until EOF. It keeps track of
    10 frequencies: '0', '1', '2', ..., '9'. The final results should be
    printed out.  Program p6.2.c

3. Given:

struct student {
  int ssn;
  char lname[20];
  char fname[20];
  int standing;
};

struct student stus[100];  //up to 100 students.

   Write a program that reads in the data for each student and stores it in the next available
   place in the array stus. It should then sort the array from smallest to largest standing.
   Finally it should print out the ssn, lname, and standing for each student. One line per 
   student.

4. Sorted! Which letters are most frequent? Write a program 
   that starts like 1) above. It uses:

struct letFreq {
  char letter;
  int f;
};

struct letFreq  lf[26];
 
   First all the f's are initialized to 0  and the letters are intialized to
   'A'  through 'Z'. Then the characters are read in and the frequencies incremented.
   Then the array is sorted from smallest to largest frequency. Finally the array
   content is printed out. Program p6.4.c
