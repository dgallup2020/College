CS151 Lab exercise #4 (10 pts)

The following are to be done in your CS151 class account.  Use the "man" command
for more information on specific commands.  You may need to use the following
commands: cd, ls, cp, mkdir, more or less, and an editor of some kind.

NOTE: To check your progress run the "labcheck 4" command to check for errors
and to see if you've successfully completed the lab.

Make a directory called lab4 in your CS151 accounts' home directory.  Inside
this directory perform the following:

1) Copy the file located at ~sbaker/public_html/cs151/class/ex4.html to your
   lab4 directory. (1pt)

2) Make sure the ex4.html file permissions are read/write for user, none
   for group and read only for other. (1pt)

3) Edit the ex4.html file and follow the instructions inside it.  Compare your
   result to: http://cs.indstate.edu/~sbaker/cs151/class/lab4/ref.png
   8 points possible:
     +3 points for no HTML warnings or errors and matches the reference
     +5 points if your page matches the reference image:
        +2 points for a working table
        +3 points for correct CSS styling.

Note: If the 'labcheck 4' program detects that your page and the reference page
  do not match, it will install a web comparator page into your public_html
  page as the directory lab4, which will contain an index.html file and an image
  of your results.  Use the mouse and hover over the boxes below the image to
  switch back and forth between your result and the reference image to determine
  what needs to be fixed to make them match up.
