Shortest Path from s to all nodes. 

We know that a is only 3 since its a neighbor to s. A = 3
Then B is 4 because it is also a neighbor to s.  B = 4

Then we move back to a since it was shorter.
So d = 7 and g = 10. 
We are done with a.

Then we move back to b since it was second shortest from s.
So c = 7 and e = 9. We are done with B. 

Then we go to D.
The only one we can update is e, however its value is 9, which we can't update. 
so we cross D off.

Then we go to C.
C to A is too long, 

a=3
b=4
c=7
d=7
e=9
g=10
