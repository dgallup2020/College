CS469/569 Assignment #7 (10 of 11 points)

Time to work on your own CS469 virtual machine that I have setup for you. To
access your machine you can ssh to cs469@u## where ## are the last two digits of
your CS469 account.  This can be done from CS, effie or any of the A-015 Unix
lab machines. The password for the CS469 account is 'cs469'.  Change this
password immediately upon logging in for the first time.

Note that you will need to perform many of these tasks as the super user on the
machine.  You can become root, using the sudo command, 'sudo -s' or 'sudo -i'
from the cs469 account.

There is nothing to "handin", your VM will be graded after the due-date.

Tasks to be performed:

0) Change your VM's cs469 account password to one only you know. (changed
password) 

1) (1pt) Change the host-name:  Your virtual machines host name should be:
   u##.indstate.edu where ## is the last two digits of your CS469 user-name. Use
   the "hostname" command to set the host-name immediately (w/o having to
   reboot), and edit the file /etc/HOSTNAME to make it permanent. Be sure to
   keep the domain .indstate.edu appended to your machines host name when
   editing /etc/HOSTNAME. (checked, did both and made sure)

2) (1pt) Make a swap "file":  Use the "dd" command to make a 512MB file in /
   called "swap" (i.e. /swap) then chmod it so only root can read it, use mkswap
   to setup the swap file. Add an entry in /etc/fstab (man 5 fstab) for your
   swap file, and finally use swapon to turn it on. If you're successful you
   should see the addition of swap with the "free" command.

   NOTE: It is incorrect to put your swap file in the wrong place, to have the
   wrong permissions, to be the wrong size and to not be listed correctly in
   /etc/fstab (swap file in at /) (believed this is right) 

3) Backup your system to effie:
 a) (1pt) First create a public ssh key for the root account:  Become root, then
    in /root/.ssh/ create a ssh key-pair using "ssh-keygen".  Create an rsa or
    an ecdsa key type.  This should create two files, one with a .pub ending.
    Use ssh-copy-id to install the public key part into your class cs469##
    account. You should have a copy of the .pub file in your
      ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    file if you've done it correctly. The root account on your virtual machine
    should be able to login to your cs/effie account from w/o requiring a
    password now.

    (created the rsa key, copied it over to the class account from root) (Made
sure both have the same key) (won't let me login from root vm to class account
tho) 

    NOTE: It is fairly important that you protect access to your CS account by
    making sure you are using a secure password only you know for your virtual
    machine's CS469 account.

 b) (2pts) Create a script called 'backup' that backs up the entire system to a
    directory (/net/bkups/cs469##/) on effie using "rsync".  It should not
    backup the "/swap" file you setup in step 1 above. The directory
    /net/bkups/cs469##/ on _effie_ should only be accessible by you. The script
    should be made executable and installed into /usr/local/bin/. The last line
    of the script should use an ssh command to run the "touch" command on the
    backup directory on effie to indicate the time when your backup completed.
    
    NOTE: A single command can be run on a remote machine by adding the command
    at the end of the ssh command, for example: ssh user@host "command".  Your
    backup must be stored in cs469##@effie:/net/bkups/cs469##/

 c) (1pt) Create a cron entry for your backup script to be run every night at a
    specific time.  As root, run 'crontab -e' and add the entry.  The time yours
    should run is 1am + (10minutes * ##) where ## is the last two digits of your
    CS469 user name.  Thus if your username was cs46911 you would schedule your
    backup at 2:50am.

4) (1pt) Give the sbaker account sudo (root) access to your machine.  Edit the
   /etc/group database (man 5 group) and append my user-name to the "wheel"
   group.

5) (1pt) Setup the MariaDB database server:  Read the file /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld
   and setup the server. Make sure that the server will start at boot (make the
   /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld script executable.) If you mess up the installation just
   remove all the files in /var/lib/mysql/ and start over.

6) (1pt) Create a .my.cnf file in the root account that will automatically login
   to the MariaDB server as the root user.  Use the Internet to figure this one
   out.
    
   NOTE: this file should only be accessible by root.

7) (1pt) Setup the Apache HTTP server (/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd) Make it start on boot
   and configure /etc/httpd/* to use /net/web as its document root directory
   (Note: Do NOT change the "server root" directory) and enable PHP, making sure
   that index.php is accepted as a default web page in addition to index.html.
   Make a test index.php file in /net/web and verify that your web server is
   working by browsing to http://effie.indstate.edu:469##/

-- index.php --
<?php
  echo phpinfo();
?>
-- index.php --

8) (1pt) Transfer to your machine the the Slackware package:
   effie:/net/misc/sbopkg-0.38.0-noarch-1_wsr.tgz
   and install it using the 'installpkg' command.  After installing it, sync the
   remote repository with the local mirror, use sbopkg -h for help.  Use sbopkg
   to then install "rclone".
