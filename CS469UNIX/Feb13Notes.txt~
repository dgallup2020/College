Feb 13th Notes:
Homework Due Friday. Still add sbaker as a user.

Last classes notes was a continuation on scripting. 

cont. Bracket and Variable Expansion: 
A word is expanded for all the possible meaning it would have. variables and
wildcards are common ones. 
{n..m} expands from n to m 
ex. {a..z} {01..20} cs469{00..20}
only two periods

{n..m..5} expands from n to m incrementing by 5.

$var Expands the variable <var>.  
${var} Expands the variable <var>
${var[index]} expands the <index> element of the array <var> 
${var[*]} expands <var> in the same way as $*. 
${var[@]} expands <var> in the same way as $@
${#var[*]} expands to # elements in the array <var> 
${!var[*]} expands to the associative array ekys of var
${var:-word} use <words> as a default if var is unset or null. 
${var:?word} display the error 'word' if var is unset or null. 

ex. Script
#!/bin/bash
src=
${1:?usage: get source [dert]";
