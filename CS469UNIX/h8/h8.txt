CS469/569 Assignment #8 - 10 points

3 commands to know: fdisk, parted (for part a), mdadm (part c)

  More system administration tasks to be performed on your virtual machines.
(The ones you login to from cs/effie via ssh cs469@u## where ## are the last
two digits of your cs469 account name.)

  After you have completed the following handin your 'h8' directory with your
machines completed /etc/fstab file, the output of the 'fdisk -l' command (as
partitions.txt) minus the entries for the ram drives and your arc.sh script.

1) Time to add some file-systems to your virtual machines.  I have added four
   additional "sata" drives, each 4GB in size as devices /dev/sd[b-e] to your
   virtual machines.  Use these drives to perform the following tasks. (7pts)

  +============================================================================+
  | Under no circumstances should you do anything whatsoever to your /dev/sda* |
  | drive.  Wiping out your system partition shall be a deduction of 3 points. |
  +============================================================================+

  Tasks to be performed:

  A) (2pts) Using fdisk and/or parted, partition the virtual drives:
     i) On the sdb device: partition the drive with a GPT disk-label into 4
        separate 1GB partitions. Consider using parted to do this.
    ii) Partition the sdc, sdd and sde drives with a DOS (for this fdisk will
        do) partition type and make two 2GB partitions on each device, both with
        the: "Linux raid auto detect" (fd) partition type.

  B) (2pts) Using mke2fs or mkfs.* format the partitions on /dev/sdb:
     i) Format the first partition as a ext2 file-system.
    ii) Format the second partition as a ext3 file-system.
   iii) Format the third partition as a ext4 file-system.
    iv) Format the fourth partition as a xfs file-system.

  C) (1pt) Use the mdadm command to create:
     i) A RAID 0 virtual device (/dev/md0) using the first partition on each of
        sdc, sdd and sde.
    ii) A RAID 5 virtual device (/dev/md1) using the second partition on each of
        sdc, sdd and sde.

  D) (1pt) Format the RAID virtual drives (/dev/md*).  Make them both ext4.

  E) (1pt) Edit the system fstab file and make the above newly created
     partitions permanently mounted at the following mount points:
     - Mount the ext2 partition on sdb at /net
     - Mount the ext3 partition on sdb at /net/log
     - Mount the ext4 partition on sdb at /net/ftp
     - Mount the xfs partition on sdb at /net/tmp
     - Mount the RAID 5 file-system at /net/web
     - Mount the RAID 0 file-system at /bkup

2a) (2pts) Create a script called 'arc.sh' (in /usr/local/bin/) that creates a
   "tar" archive file of your /etc directory that is compressed using 'xz'
   compression that includes the date in the file name of the archive, but do
   not use spaces in your file name.  The script should store the archive in
   the directory '/var/archive' (creating the directory it if it doesn't
   exist) and keep only the last 10 such archives.

2b) (1pt) Create a cron entry (for root) that runs the arc.sh script nightly at
   2am.
