HW #1	(8 Points, 1/2pt each) Name:

Using a text editor of your choice, edit this file and write in the answers to
the following questions. Use the "man" command to reference any of the named
commands. When asked how to do something, write out the command you would use
to do it:

 1. Command to change your password?
    >passwd

 2. What is the full absolute path to your home directory?
    >/u1/class/cs46905

 3. Using the "cp" command, how would you make a copy of a file called "file1"
    as "file2"?

    >cp file1 file2


 4. Using "cp", how would you make a copy of a directory called 'dir1' and all
    its contents as 'dir2'?

    >cp -r dir1 dir2


 5. Copy command to copy all the files in the current directory to the directory
    ~/.trash/, that makes numbered backups of any files that may already be in
    the destination.

    >cp -r -b ~ ~/.trash/

 6. How would you use "scp" to copy "dir1" to the home directory of "user1" on
    the machine "host.indstate.edu"?

    >scp -r dir1 user1@host.indstate.edu


 7. Using "cp" to copy a directory "src1" to "dest1" preserving all the meta-
    information about the files?

    >cp -r -a src1 dest1

 8. How would you rename the file "in" to "out"?
    
    >mv in out

 9. "ls" command to list ALL the contents of a directory in long format, sorted
    in reverse by last modification time?

    >ls -l -t


10. How would you use "mkdir", in a single invocation, to make the sub-directory
    path "x/y/z" in your home directory?
    >mkdir -p a/b/c

11. What would be the "chmod" command to set the permissions on a file such that
    the owner had full access, the group could read only and other users could
    not access the file at all?
    >chmod 740 filename

12. "chmod" command to make sure that a file is executable for everyone, but
    w/o modifying the other permissions, whatever they may be?
    >chmod ugo+x file


13. Give the wild-card pattern that would match all text (.txt) files (case
    insensitive, i.e. ".Txt", ".txt", ".TXT" should all match) that begin with
    either an "R" or an "r".  Therefore the wild-card should match "README.TXT",
    "r.txt", etc:
    >[rR]?*.txt


14. How would you use the "stat" command to just print the file type for the
    file "file1"?
    >stat --format "%F" file1

15. How would you use the "tail" command to watch the end of the log file
    /var/log/http/access_log as lines are appended to it in real time?
    >tail -f /var/log/http/access_log

16. How would you use the "du" command to produce only the total usage for the
    amount of disk space your home directory is using in human readable format.
    >du -h
