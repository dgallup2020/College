CS469/569 Assignment #9 - 10 of 11 points

Time to make sure your web server is setup and install some web services on your
virtual machine (ssh to cs469@u## from CS/Effie):

Tasks to be performed:

0) (0pts) Setup the Apache HTTP server. This task should have been completed in
   H7, please see me if you need help with this task. Make your web server
   start on boot (i.e. make /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd executable) and configure
   /etc/httpd/httpd.conf to use /net/web as its document root directory
   (Note: Do NOT change the "server root" directory) and enable PHP, making sure
   that index.php is accepted as a default web page in addition to index.html.
   Make a test index.php file in /net/web and verify that your web server is
   working by browsing to:

   http://effie.indstate.edu:469##/

-- index.php --
<?php
  echo phpinfo();
?>
-- index.php --

  Or you may use the text based "lynx" browser:
   > lynx http://localhost/info.php

1) (1pt) Add an entry in /etc/hosts (man 5 hosts) for your machine in the
  following format:

  <ip-address>	<host-name>.indstate.edu <host-name>

  Substitute <ip-address> and <host-name> for your machines IP address (use
  /sbin/ifconfig eth0 to find it) and host-name respectively (should be u## by
  now)

2) (2pts) Get the drupal tar-ball (in effie:/net/soft/) and extract/install it
  into your web area as /net/web/drupal. (read 'man tar' for information on how
  to extract a tar archive.) It should not have the version number on the
  directory name, so you will have to rename it after extracting it.

3) (2pts) Create a MySQL database for your Drupal installation and an associated
  account w/ password for it.

4) (2pts) Finish the Drupal installation. (browse to
   http://effie.indstate.edu:469##/drupal/ and follow the online instructions)


5) (1pt) Get the mediawiki tar-ball (in effie:/net/soft/) and extract/install it
  into your web area as /net/web/wiki.  It should not have the version number on
  the directory name, so you will have to rename it after extracting it.

6) (1pt) Create a MySQL database for your wiki installation and an associated
  account w/ password for it.

7) (2pts) Finish the wiki installation
  (browse to http://effie.indstate.edu:469##/wiki/)
