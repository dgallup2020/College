START HOMEWORK THE DAY OF GIVEN, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE
	QUESTION ON THE NEXT DAY
	SPLIT UP THE WORK
	THE UNIX LAB IS A RESOURCE, USE IT

Conventions: 
>    <----- represents a normal user prompt
#    <----- " a super user prompt
		The super-user is the user with uid 0. is the system
administrator

[word] <----- the word is "optional". everything inside the brackets is
optional

ls [-a] the -a is optional

<word>  <----- replace <word> with what word represents. 

the man command:
> man [<section #>] <command|config file/topic> 
> man -k <search term> 
> man man
sections:
1 <---- user commands
2,3 <---- system calls/Clibrary functions
4 <---- Device and Special files
5 <---- File formats & conventions
6 <---- Games, etc.
7 <---- misc
8 <---- system admin tools & daemons

the info command: 
> info <command> <---- similar to man, but for GNU utilities
		info make is a good command for compilers

File and Dir Command, ysak
> ls [-a][-l][<path>] <---- lists files in a dir
  -a lists all files including "hidden files" (files that startwith w/ a dot
(.))
  -l long listting (print meta-data for each file)

> cd [<dir>] <---- changes the working dir
your current working dir is not your home dir

> cp [-r][-a] <source(s)...> <destination>
   -r copy a dir recursively and all of its contents
   -a copy the meta-data as well

>mv [-r] <source(s)> <destination> <---- move/rename files/directories
   -r recursively

>rm [-r] <file/directory> <---- removes or deletes files/directories
   -r recursive (DANGEROUS) 

>mkdir [-p] <dir> <---- makes a new dir 
   -p makes any missing parents directories 
	- using -p you can make a tree of directories, also fails silently
>rmdir <dir> -removes only empty directories

Basic Networking & File Copying:
>ssh [<username>@]<hostname>[<commands>] <---- secure shell to another
>computer.

to make a public/private key pair:
>ssh-keygen -t {ecdsa/rsa}
	-generates id_<algo>.pub  -public key
	           id_<algo>      -private key
	cat id_ecdsa.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


   

>scp [-r] <source> <destination> <---- copies files using ssh (and its
>encrypted) 
	<source> or <destinaiton> can be a remote host specificaiton:
ex. [<username>@]<hostname>:[<remote-path>]

> rsync [-a][-x][-r] <source> <destination> <---- like scp, compares the two
> and only transfered what changed/missing files
  -a archive mode copies meta-data
  -x stay on one filesystem
  -r recursive 
good way of keeping a updating a local host from a remote destination

>handin <---- lists assignments, any submissions you made
>handin -C / handin --checkout <assignment> 
  -fetch the assignment to your directory
>handin <assignment>  <---- submits your work
>handin -g <assignment> 
  -see grading notes for assignments
