Your assignment is to login to effie.indstate.edu (ssh -Y effie.indstate.edu
the -Y option is important to run the X-windows VirtualBox application)
and create your own virtual machine and install Linux on it (preferably
Slackware -- iso's available in /net/iso/ and /net/iso/slack on effie), but
you have the option of installing some other flavor of Linux, such as Debian,
CentOS, Fedora, etc.)  **Your virtual hard drive images should be stored in
`/net/class/`*username* on effie and not in your CS home directories.**

Once you have made your machine and installed it, create an account for
yourself and an "sbaker" account for me with some password that you will
provide me in the file called passwd.txt in the h3 directory. The "adduser"
or "useradd" commands will usually do the trick when making accounts.

You may configure your virtual machines networking in *Bridged Adaptor*
mode (and no other) for Ethernet device eth2, and then configure your OS with
the following network information:

         IP Address: 10.0.14.1XX (where XX is the last two digits of your CS469
		     account)
            Netmask: 255.255.255.0
  Broadcast Address: 10.0.14.255
            Gateway: 10.0.14.1
       Name-servers: 139.102.7.102 and 139.102.1.10

On Slackware the networking is usually setup at installation or you can
edit the file /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf and /etc/resolv.conf
(man 5 resolv.conf). You should make sure that you are running an ssh server
on your machine that allows you to remotely login to it via ssh.  It ought
to be accessible from the cs server and Effie if you use the above IP
address.

After you have setup your virtual machine, you will need to run it in
"headless mode", that is run it in the background so you don't need to be
logged into Effie to run it. This can be done with the following command:

  nohup VBoxHeadless --startvm _vmname_ < /dev/null >& /tmp/_vmname_.log &

where _vmname_ is the name you gave your Virtual Machine (it should be the same
as your cs469 username.) The command "VBoxManage list vms" will give you the
name of your VM if you're not sure. If you wish to have a second (or more) VMs,
please let me know and I will allocate an IP address for your machine(s).

The video of me creating and installing the virtual machine in class is
available at:

  http://cs.indstate.edu/~sbaker/video/play.php?vid=VirtualBox

Note: that in the video I suggest that you don't need the X packages, however
you probably do (some of the networking programs are linked to some of the X
libraries.) Just install everything (full install) and you shouldn't have any
problems.  Also when configuring the networking, the last two digits of the
IP address does not add 50 (so just the last two digits of your cs469 account
are used, do not add 50 to them.)
