Making FS Notes: 
mkfs.ext4 -0 64Bit -i 32768 Inodes <location> 
-m argument, setting aside some of the file system for root. so only the drive
can use the latter. 
then you mount the location of the new fs, and mount it to yours. 

-file systems have different check programs and doing so we can 
-tune2fs kinda neat because it tells you all about a certain filesystem. shows
a whole lot of metadata. 

Different Blcok Devices:

uuid: looks like a random sequence of bits, and it is completely unique. 
file system labels. 
dev/disk: we have a array of hardware id's 

We don't usually make dev anymore, but udev now makes then for us. 

fstab
file system tables that are mounted.
