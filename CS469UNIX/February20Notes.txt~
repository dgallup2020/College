varible (<names) lsited. 
 -p prompt <--- print prompt before reading input. 
 -s  <--- do not echo input characters.
 -n nchars <--- sto pafter reading nchars.
 ...

notes using this in passwd.sh

operator, such as:
if[[-f <file>]]; then echo "is a regular file", fi
-f x <--- x exists & is regular
-d x <--- ... as a directory
-L x <--- ... as a symbolic link
-e x <--- file exists

source <file> [params]
. <file> [<params>]
  -reads and executes <file> in the current shell.
  -a lot like #include in C
