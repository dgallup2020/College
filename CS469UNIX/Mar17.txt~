Notes on Week 10 Lesson
- creating a swap file
>dd if=/dev/zero of=swap bs-in count-5 (5 megabytes)
makes sure to chmod 600 the file
format via mkswap, the labels are used for fstab, you can specify your devices
via labels in the cases where devices change. seeing a swap now in the free
command. 

devices are basically store devices of linear array of data. aka big text file 
its formatted a partitions. 
usb drives probably only have 1 partitions if anything like a fat file system
(default like windows uses). 



mounting overlays itself over a directories files, mount point,. unmounting a
device allows you to see those file inside that mount point once again. before
mounting a devices.
