Notes (1/21/20)
-Drives / partitions are mapped onto the root file-system or sub-mounted
  file-system at the "mout point" with the mount(8) command: 
  ex. mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
-mounted file-system are removed using the umount(8) command
  ex. umount /mnt

>df [-h][-i]
 -Display mounted file-systems and amount of space on them: 
  -h <---- human readable
  -i <---- inode information

Meta/Inode file information (man 2 stat)
-An inode is the actual file. Files in directories merely point
  to an inode. A file pointer to an inode is a "hard link", and they
  increase the inodes hard link count. When the hard link count is drops
  to zero, the inode is freed. The file information might note actually be
  deleted, just un-referenced, so it is sometimes possible to recover the
  deleted data if the file-system is immediately unmounted(or set to
read-only) and special recovery programs are used to recover the data. 

-Inodes contain the following meta-data: 
  -owner <--- uid and gid (user and group owner id) (unsigned 32 bit ints) 
  -mode <--- (file permission bits (& file type) shown in octal:) 
     4000 -setuid allows the setuid(2) (change effective user id) 
           system call to work. Setuid() is restricted to the uid of the 
           owner of the file (unrestricted if the owner is uid 0 (i.e. the
           user user)). 
     2000 -setgid allows setgid()/setegid(0, same as w/ set setuid above
     1000 -'sticky bit' on directories it sets a restricted deleted mode which
           prevent users from removing/renmaing files/dir not owned by them.
           Used on /tmp for example. 
     0x00 -owner bits
     00x0 -group bits
     000x -other bits
     x=4 read(w) /list files in a directory
     x=2 write(w) /add/remove entries to a directory
     x=1 execute(x) /search or cd into a directory
  -size(bytes & blocks) 32 or 64 bits in size. 
  -times:(time_t)
     atime - last access time (last time file was read) 
     mtime - last modification time (last time the file was written to or
             updated) 
     ctime - last status change time (meta data was updated) 
  -inode & device number -Internally in the kernal (operating system that
     runs all the other programs) all file-system objects are uniquely 
     identified by the combinaation of these two numbers

>ls -l output decoded:
  ex. -rw-r--r-- 1 root users 283 Jan 13 18:52 file.txt
goes in accending order:
file type
owner permissions
group permissions
other permissions
hard-link count
owner 
group owner
file size
last time modified
file name

File-types:
- <---- regular file
d <---- directory
l <---- symbolic link (point to anywhere on the file system, even to other
drives
p <--- pipe(FIFO) (note: mkfifo makes a pipe) 
c <--- character special (typically serial data) 
b <--- Block special (typically disks) 
s <--- socket files (unix domain socket) 
? <--- unknown (bad) 

>chmod [-R] <mode> <file(s)...> 
  -R = recursive
  -sets /modifies permissions on files. <mode> has two forms.
     Octal(numeric) or ASCII forms: 
       rwxrwxrwx each 3 grouping is a octal. the octal form only replaces
                 perms 
       user group other all(default)
       + - = 
       r w x s="setuid/setgid" t=sticky
       comma seperated list, no spaces (mode must be one "word") 
       ex. chmod g+r //adding reading access to the group (we are adding this
           bit) 
       ex. chmod g-r // we are only removing reading access. it doesn't
           entirely modify the permissions. 
# chown [-R] <owner>[:<group>] <file(s)...> 
  -set ownership on files. 
>chgrp [-R] <group><file(s)...>
  -set group ownership on files. 
>touch <file...>
  -updates last access & modification times of files, creating new files if
     necessary
>umask[<octal #>]
   -set/show the default file/directory permissions creation mask. Default
    permissions are:
      <default mode>  0777 for directories
    & ~umask          0666 for files. 
  -----------------
      <actual permissions> 
      umask typically = 022
      when we create a new file/directory we subtract/bitwise-and the umask from the
default permissions. and that create our default file permissions. 

Access Control Lists:
-some files-systems maybe support access ACL permissions which if present on
 a file, completely supercede the regular permission. 
ACL's are viewed with getfacl and set w/ setfacl, and a file has ACL's if ls
listing shows a '+' after the permissions.
